        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Homepage</strong> <br>
The homepage will begin with a friendly introduction of myself and what the website is about. I want the people to know what they will find in the content in a nutshell. I will discuss topics related to mindful productivity, energy and time management, and essentialism, or the art to live with what matters. The people will find answers and experiences regarding how to stay organized, productive, not waste time with inefficiencies, and how to discover the meaning behind everything we do. The homepage will contain a picture or video introduction of the topics I will cover and why they want to visit it. People will come to my site to get a different perspective on topics that have been discussed many times. We all know that we should keep an updated calendar and to-do list, right? But how can we do it an easy, productive, and fun way? Are the things that I am doing working towards my life vision? All these and more questions will be addressed in the blog articles. People that will come on my site can read the blog posts or get in touch with me for a private consultation. I want to help people with their productivity system and workflow. I want to help them implement strategies and techniques that will improve the quality of their lives. <br><br>


<strong>Mindful Productivity</strong> <br>
The difference between my approach and other websites/method is that I have created my craft around the concept of being mindful of the person, not only the task. Most productivity system are focused on getting more organized inboxes, in-trays, emails, etc. which is great. However, there is a lack of perspective or greater purpose to this activity. My method helps the person realize what is the vision the he or she wants to accomplish and then working on the application tools to achieve it. If I don’t know where I am going, every path is correct, and no one is. The final objective of Mindful Productivity is to combine practices from mindfulness, yoga, meditation, with the latest tools and techniques to stay organized and productive. The end goal is to bring peace and calmness of mind. To be present whenever we are. Giving our complete self to the task at hand, without worrying that there is something better or more important that we should be doing. Mindful Productivity will help you achieve a relaxed state of control. <br><br>

<strong>Energy Management vs. Time Management</strong> <br>
Most of my life I have heard people that told me, “If you want to be productive, you have to schedule your day and stick to it.” I have found that the problem with time management is not about time, but about energy levels. If you are running low on energy, chances are that you won’t accomplish anything on your neat calendar. Have you ever felt great about planning, only to discover that you were done by 5pm and just sit on the couch binging on Netflix? The problem was not scheduling, but mindful scheduling considering your energy levels. There are different practices that you can find on the website that will help you increase your energy levels and understand which type of activity are appropriate at specific times of the day. We will define each task as “low”, “medium”, or “high” energy level and we will schedule it at appropriate times of the day. You will discover a whole new level of productivity by considering how you feel. What if you cannot schedule a high-level activity on a different time of the day and you know you will feel drained? No worries. We will share with you different ways in which you can manage and increase your energy level on-demand. <br><br>

<strong>Essentialism</strong> <br>
Lately, there has been a great hype about “minimalism”, or the art of living with less. George McKeown, with his book titles “Essentialism”, revolutionized the concept of minimalism with the concept of living with what is essential. What is essential in your life? On our website we explore ways to define what is essential and how fill our lives with things that matter most. Essentialism does not mean living with less per se, it means understanding what is important to us and what is not. We tend to clutter our lives with non-essential things in the pursuit of happiness. You can discover the joy and freedom of unchaining yourself from constricting paradigms and experiences life at fullest. That is the essence of essentialism.

In addition, there will be a list of topics to make it easier for the person to read articles related to their interests. <br> <br>
